# Description 

# Installation

1. Download/Clone this repository

2. You can run the demo by doing `python generate_collage.py`, or you can open the generate_collage.py file and read the description of the generate_collage() function for further documentation on using this program/script. The explanation in the function there should be plenty to get started on making collages using my script. Just in case it isn't or you are lazy, I have included the documentation above this section of the README, in the Description section.
